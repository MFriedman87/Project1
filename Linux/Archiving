Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt.
Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.


Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1.	Command to extract the TarDocs.tar archive to the current directory: tar xvf TarDocs.tar.gz
2.	Command to create the Javaless_Doc.tar archive from the TarDocs/ directory, while excluding the TarDocs/Documents/Java directory: tar cvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude= home/sysadmin/Projects/TarDocs/Documents/Java
3.	Command to ensure Java/ is not in the new Javaless_Docs.tar archive: tar tvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java
Bonus 
•	Command to create an incremental archive called logs_backup_tar.gz with only changed files to snapshot.file for the /var/log directory: sudo tar --listed-incremental=snapshot.file -zcvf logs_backup.tar.gz /var/log

Critical Analysis Question
•	Why wouldn't you use the options -x and -c at the same with tar? 
-x is to extract the contents of an archive and -c is to create an archive file

Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs
1.	Cron job for backing up the /var/log/auth.log file:
0 6 * * */4 tar -zcf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log
________________________________________
Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts
1.	Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: 
mkdir ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}
2.	Paste your system.sh script edits below:  
#!/bin/bash
              free > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
du > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
lsof /dev/null > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
df > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
3.	Command to make the system.sh script executable: 
chmod 755 system.sh
Optional
•	Commands to test the script and confirm its execution: 
~/backups/diskuse
Ls -lt
cat disk_usage.txt
Bonus
•	Command to copy system to system-wide cron directory:

Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
1.	Run sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf to edit the logrotate configuration file.
Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the /var/log/auth.log.
o	Add your config file edits below: 
# see "man logrotate" for details
 rotate log files weekly
weekly
 use the syslog group by default, since this is the owning group
 of /var/log/syslog.
su root syslog
 keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 4
# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
#create
# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
#compress
# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d
# no packages own wtmp, or btmp -- we'll rotate them here
/var/log/auth.log {weekly rotate 7
 Notifempty

 missingok }
/var/log/btmp>/dev/null 2>&1 {
    missingok
    monthly
    create 0660 root utmp
    rotate 7}
