2.	Add users sam, joe, amy, and sara to the managed group.
	Command to add users to engineers group (include all four users): usermod -aG engineers sam, usermod -aG engineers joe, usermod -aG engineers amy, usermod -aG engineers sara
3.	Create a shared folder for this group at /home/engineers.
	Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir /home/engineers
